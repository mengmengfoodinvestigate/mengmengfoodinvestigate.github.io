  As Japan is a sea island nation, the Japanese have a strong taste for seafood -- including fish, shellfish, octopus, shrimp and crabs, and seaweed.</p>
  <p>Japanese cuisine is divided into three main categories: homme cuisine, Kaiseki cuisine and Hoi Mat cuisine.</p>
  <p>A cooking system based on traditional culture and customs. Originated from the Muromachi era, is the product of the Japanese Rifa system. Formal &quot;home-cooked food&quot; is not common anymore. It only appears on a few formal occasions, such as weddings and funerals, coming-of-age ceremonies and sacrificial feasts. The dishes range from five dishes and two soups to seven dishes and three soups.</p>
  <p>Kaiseki An elaborate dish prepared for guests prior to the tea ceremony. In medieval Japan (referring to the Kamakura and Muromachi periods in Japan), the tea ceremony was formed, and from this came Kaiseki, which was based on very strict rules. In Japanese cuisine, the earliest and most orthodox cooking system is Kaiseki, which has a history of more than 450 years. According to ancient Japanese legend, Kaiseki is derived from the Zen monk's warm stone. At that time, Zen monks were required to eat only breakfast and lunch and not eat in the afternoon. The young monk, however, could not bear the hunger and cold, so he wrapped the heated stone in rags, called the warm stone, and carried it in his arms against his stomach. Later gradually developed to eat a little less, play the role of &quot;warm stone&quot; imperial hunger and cold.</p>
  <p>With the development of social activities of ordinary Japanese citizens, Japanese restaurants came into being. It's probably a simplified version based on honmo and Kaiseki. It also includes a variety of local cuisines. Matsuki is usually served in restaurants that specialize in Japanese food.</p>
