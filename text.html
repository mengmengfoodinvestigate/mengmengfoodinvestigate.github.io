  <h1>Japanese food culture</h1>
  <p>China is a neighbor of Japan, and Japanese food also has a certain origin with Chinese food. In today's China, you can also taste a variety of Japanese food, so I want to have a deeper understanding of the Japanese food culture I have learned in this semester.</p>
  <p>Japan as the &quot;Thousand island country&quot; diet is extremely rich, in ancient times mainly cereals, and fish and shellfish, seaweed, vegetables, bird and animal meat; Now Western-influenced cuisine has gradually been accepted by the Japanese, and individual tastes are free to play.</p>
  <p>The way of making food in Japan is mainly boiling, steaming and frying. Their food tastes very light and the amount is relatively small. However, they pay great attention to the collocation of dishes and tableware and should not be wasted. They pay great attention to etiquette, so they will say some polite words before and after the meal to thank the host for his hospitality. There will be taboos in etiquette, so in Japan, can not be filled with too full or pointed; Don't fill your meal in front of your guests; When eating, one should not stick one's chopsticks in the bowl, which is the practice at the altar of the dead, which is the same as in China. Guests can not eat with just a bowl, a bowl meaning no. Of course, Japanese black bean sauce has its own quirks. They gorge themselves on black bean sauce in a way that goes against their strict etiquette. When you eat the noodles, it makes a sound in your mouth. This means the noodles are delicious and compliments the cook. Japanese cuisine is also known as &quot;five tastes, five colors and five methods&quot; cuisine. The five tastes are &quot;sweet, sour, spicy, bitter and salty&quot;. The five colors are &quot;white, yellow, blue, red and black&quot;; The five methods are &quot;raw, boiled, fried, roasted and steamed&quot;; The principle of tasting Japanese food is &quot;fragrant, abundant, ripe, sweet and tender&quot;.</p>
  <p>When it comes to Japanese cuisine, Kaiseki should be the No. 1 dish. This kind of cuisine is light, simple, small and full of Zen, which can better reflect its charm in the quiet environment. As Japan has learnt more of the essence of different countries in every aspect, shadow of China can also be found in their diet. Zhuo BLDG is one of them. In fact, Zhuo BLDG is China's eight heavenly table where everyone sits on backrest chairs and gathers food around the table. The Japanese adapted it and added fish and meat to make it a Japanese specialty. Japan also has its own unique views on vegetarian dinners, which are represented by Ashram cuisine, where buckwheat noodles, tofu, pickled vegetables and other vegetarian ingredients are selected.</p>
  <p>In addition to cooking, Japan has a lot of specialty food, such as: Sashimi, sushi, takoyaki, buckwheat noodles, Kanto boil, which is the most representative of course sashimi, Sashimi is Japanese sashimi, with fresh sea fish, sea shell production, and then stained with soy sauce, wasabi, which is a relatively light dish. The most popular traditional dish in Japan is sushi. Cold rice seasoned with vinegar, fish, seafood, vegetables, eggs, etc., becomes a delicate and delicious dish. The mixture of various ingredients makes people want to stop eating. And, of course, the national snack, takoyaki, which is crispy, tender, delicious and cheap.</p>
  <p>Of course, in addition to staple food and non-staple food, Japan also has desserts, tea, wine and other foods, such as wagyu fruit, potato, causeway yaki and other desserts; Green tea, fried tea, cherry blossom tea and other tea; Sake, shochu, beer and other alcoholic drinks. Japanese love to eat sweet, so dessert is essential, the streets are full of dessert shops; Tea ceremony is popular in Japan, especially at home will be necessary, before and after the meal is the best time to enjoy tea; The most indispensable thing for men to communicate their feelings is wine. At this time, izakaya becomes a gathering place for men and a good place to liberate themselves.</p>
  <p>Although Japan has a small area, its diet is rich and colorful. They like to keep the original flavor and form of food, with a small amount of processing and seasoning, which is light, simple and delicate, which is an old Chinese saying: conform to nature. People depend on food, a food word out of a country's culture, write a nation's belief, this is Japan.</p>
