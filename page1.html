  <p>Sukiyaki can also be called hoe yaki. It is said that it first originated in the early period of Japan. When farmers were busy in farming, they simply used the flat parts of the available iron farm tools, such as hoes and plows, to barbecue meat on the fire and eat. By now, of course, Sukiyaki has become much more than simply barbecued meat on a simple iron plate. It has become the quintessential Japanese cuisine for top-notch beef; When a family comes to get together or celebrate, it often makes careful preparations for the whole family to enjoy it. But for all that, the beloved Sukiyaki remains remarkably simple and uncomplicated in content and practice, imbued with the simplicity and refinement that characterizes Japanese cuisine. The material mainly consisted of beef, shallots, vegetables, konnyaku and tofu, and the sauce and procedure had different recipes and procedures according to different regions. For example, the popular earlier Kansai, generally do not adjust the sauce first, but with butter hot pot, slightly fried beef, sprinkle sugar directly, pour into soy sauce to continue cooking, then put vegetables and other ingredients. Sukiyaki kanto style, will advance the soy sauce, sugar, mirin and stock to reconcile into a sauce called &quot;under the cut リ&quot;, and beef cooking together again. However, the above steps are only general definitions. After reading various recipes in China and Japan and comparing the practices of various shops, I found that Kanto and Kansai have gradually become confused. Heat the pan with butter, or just pour the sauce to a boil? Saute the meat before you put the sauce or sauce before you cook the meat? Beef first or with vegetables? Depending on the place, the shop, the custom, and there are all kinds of subtle differences, it is very dazzling.</p>
